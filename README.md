# Description

User types in city and the input runs through a function that fecthes weather data based upon the Open Weather API and displays the current weather with icon and date and time as well as a five day forecast for that city. Icons are provided by the API. Used three different API's one for the current weather, one for the five day forecast, and one for the UV Index. It was tricky to initially get the API data to display in the console but once I was able to get the first bit of data out of the API it became easy to extract the data and link specific elements to the html for display.
